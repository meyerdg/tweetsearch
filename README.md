Find tweets twitter search won't return 

### Note
- This is an exhaustive search and so is ***extremely*** **time intensive**. 
- Don't expect quick results but do expect thorough results. 
- If the tweet exists, this ***will*** find it.

Based on a twitter-backup script written by JWZ - https://www.jwz.org/hacks/twit-backup.pl

and released snowflake (tweet id) generator code from twitter translated from scala to perl
https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010

Requires several perl modules and a twitter API enabled account. 

There is help for both in this script and may or may not still be valid. It's left in place from JWZs original tweet dump code.

This scripts as written was mainly used here:
