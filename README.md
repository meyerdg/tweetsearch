Find tweets twitter search won't return

Based on a twitter-backup script written by JWZ - https://www.jwz.org/hacks/twit-backup.pl
and released snowflake (tweet id) generator code from twitter translated from scala to perl
https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010

Needs several perl modules, a twitter API enabled account. The help in this script might work okay. It's left in place from JWZs code. I haven't changed it (much).

This scripts as written was mainly used here:
